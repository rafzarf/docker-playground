# Docker Playground

Welcome to the Docker Playground! This repository is designed to learn and experiment with Docker, a popular containerization platform.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. With Docker, you can package your applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different environments.
